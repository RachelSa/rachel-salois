const HUMAN_CONTENT = `<p>I like making web apps and writing about software development.</p>

<p>Recently, I made <a href="https://github.com/RachelSa/rainward" target="_blank">Rainward</a>, the React app that helps you plan trips to dreary destinations. It has a <a href="https://floating-escarpment-37906.herokuapp.com/suggestions/" target="_blank">Rails API</a> with some snazzy <a href="https://github.com/RachelSa/rainward-api" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</a></p>

<p>My <a title="javascript" href="http://rachelsalois.com/birthday-plaid/" target="_blank">Birthday Plaid</a> app uses plain old JS, CSS grid,
 and a state-of-the-art PLAIDgorithm to generate a unique plaid for your birthday!

<p>Two things I'm thinking about lots lately:</p>
<ol>
  <li>state management (MobX, Redux)</li>
  <li>test-driven development (Jest, Enzyme)</li>
</ol>

<p>Fun fact about my <a title="career" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-salois/" target="_blank">career</a>:
 I have read (for work) more post-apocalyptic novels than anyone I know.</p>

<p>Occasionally, in my spare time, I care for a cactus that lives at my apartment.</p>

<p>This is pretty much what it looks like, give or take a few prickles.</p>`
