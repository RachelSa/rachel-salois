const HUMAN_CONTENT = `<p>I like making web apps and writing about software development.</p>

<p>Recently, I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/RachelSa/rainward" target="_blank">this React app</a> that helps you plan trips to dreary and drizzly destinations. It has a <a href="https://floating-escarpment-37906.herokuapp.com/suggestions/" target="_blank">Rails API</a> with some <a href="https://github.com/RachelSa/rainward-api" target="_blank">snazzy documentation</a>.</a></p>

<p>Fun fact <a title="career" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-salois/" target="_blank">about my career</a>: aside from working as a software engineer and technical writer, I also review and write about children's books.</p>

<p>Occasionally, in my spare time, I care for a cactus that lives at my apartment.</p>

<p>This is pretty much what it looks like, give or take a few prickles.</p>`
