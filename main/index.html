      <p>I like to make cool websites.</p>
      <p>On my blog, I write about some of my more interesting programming-related discoveries.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I tweet.</p>
      <p>I've made some fun projects using frameworks and libraries such as Rails, jQuery, React, and Redux.</p>
      <p>Fun fact about my career: I have read (for work) more post-apocalyptic novels than anyone I know.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, in my spare time, I care for a cactus that lives at my apartment.</p>
